# Sales Analysis and Dashboard Creation using Excel

## Overview:

The project aims to analyze the sales data of a retail company using Excel and create a dashboard that displays the key performance indicators and trends.

## Project Justification:

The project aims to understand the sales of bikes in the United States by analyzing the data of different age groups, employment levels, commute distances, and incomes. The project will also measure the purchasing power of the consumers by different aspects, and identify the factors that influence their buying behavior.

## Objectives: 

The project has the following objectives:

To clean and preprocess the sales data using Excel functions and tools

To calculate and visualize the Purchasing capacity by different age groups, employment levels, commute distances, and income using Excel formulas and charts

To create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that allows the user to filter and slice the data by various criteria using Excel pivot tables and slicers

To provide insights and recommendations based on the data analysis.

## Metrics for Evaluating and Monitoring:
The project will be evaluated and monitored by the following metrics:

Data quality and accuracy

Data analysis and visualization completeness and correctness

Dashboard functionality and usability

Data interpretation and reporting clarity and relevance

## Phases of Work: 
The project will be divided into four phases:

**Phase 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

Removal of duplicates to ensure data accuracy.Creation of the 'Age Brackets' column into three categories (Adolescent, midle age, old)  for analysis of age-related patterns.
Changed married column (s,m) to (single, Married) for more accuracy. Also for gender column(m,f) to (male,Female).

**Phase 2: Insightful Visualizations:** 

Utilization of visualizations, such as bar charts and line charts, to effectively convey complex trends.

**Segmentation Analysis:** 

Grouping data by income, occupation, and age brackets to uncover hidden correlations.


**Phase 3: Dashboard Creation and Formatting**

In this phase, I created a dashboard that summarizes and presents data analysis results in a clear and interactive way. Some of the tasks are:

Used Excel pivot tables and slicers to create dynamic and flexible tables that allows to filter and slice the data by different criteria, such as age group, employment level, commute distance, or income.

Formatted and customized dashboard to make it attractive and user-friendly, such as adding titles, labels, legends, colors, themes, or logos.

**Phase 4: Data Interpretation and Reporting**

In this phase, Ihave interpreted and communicated data analysis results and provide insights and recommendations for the project. 
To explore the correlation between income and bike purchases, we've created a pivot table showcasing the average income for customers who did and did not make a purchase. The results are summarized in the table below:

**Customer Commute Distance**

To understand the customer behavior, I analyzed the commute distance to buy a bike. Using Excel, I created a pivot table and a line chart that show how many bikes were sold by commute distances

**Customer Age Brackets**

I used Excel to see how many bikes were bought by different ages. The pivot table and the line chart show the number of bikes for each age group:
